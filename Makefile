#	@(#)Makefile	4.19 (Berkeley) 1/14/99
#
# This makefile is designed to be run in one of three ways:
#
#	make clean
#	make depend
#	make build
#	make installsrc
# This is the most rigorous way to rebuild the source tree.
# The first two steps will clean the source tree and remake the dependencies.
# The `make build' will compile and install the libraries and the compiler
# twice before building the rest of the sources.  The `make installsrc' will
# then install the remaining binaries.
#
#	make libthenall
#	make installsrc
# The `make libthenall' will compile and install the libraries, compile
# and install the compiler and then compile everything else.  Note,
# however, that the libraries will have been built with the old compiler.
# The `make installsrc' will then install the remaining binaries.
#
#	make all
#	make install
# The `make all' (the default) will compile everything, and install
# nothing.  The `make install' will then install everything.
#
# C library options: passed to libc makefile.
# See lib/libc/Makefile for explanation.
#
# HOSTLOOKUP must be either named or hosttable.
# DFLMON must be either mon.o or gmon.o.
# DEFS may include -DLIBC_SCCS, -DSYSLIBC_SCCS, both, or neither.
#
DEFS=		-DLIBC_SCCS
DFLMON=		mon.o

# global flags
# SRC_MFLAGS are used on makes in command source directories,
# but not in library or compiler directories that will be installed
# for use in compiling everything else.

CFLAGS=		-O
