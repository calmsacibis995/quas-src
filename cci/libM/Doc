The new floating point library consists of 5 files which define 8 functions.
The files and functions are:

	atand.c:	atan(arg), atan2(arg1, arg2)
	expd.c: 	exp(arg)
	logd.c: 	log(arg), log10(arg)
	sind.c: 	sin(arg), cos(arg)
	sqrtd.c:	sqrt(arg)

These files are archived in a library called 'libM.a'. Therefore, to use
any of these functions, the user must specify '-lM' option to 'ld(1)' as
in:

	cc c.c -lM

Note that, the standard library has some additional functions that are not
available in the new library. Therefore, to compile the programs that use
those functions from the standard library, one must specify:

	cc c.c -lM -lm

The order of appearance of '-lM' and '-lm' options is important. If '-lM'
is not specified before '-lm' none of the functions in 'libM.a' will be
loaded since they are all available in 'libm.a' also.
