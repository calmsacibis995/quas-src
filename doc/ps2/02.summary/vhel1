B.  Hardware
.PP
The
.UC "UNIX/32V"
operating system
runs on
a DEC VAX-11/780*
.FS
*VAX is a Trademark of Digital Equipment Corporation.
.FE
with at least the following equipment:
.IP
memory: 256K bytes or more.
.IP
disk: RP06, RM03, or equivalent.
.IP
tape: any 9-track MASSBUS-compatible tape drive.
.LP
The following equipment is strongly recommended:
.IP
communications controller such as DZ11 or DL11.
.IP
full duplex 96-character ASCII terminals.
.IP
extra disk for system backup.
.LP
The system is normally distributed on 9-track tape.
The minimum memory and disk space specified is enough to run
and maintain
.UC "UNIX/32V,"
and to keep all source on line.
More memory will be needed
to handle
a large number of users,
big data bases, diversified complements of devices, or large
programs.
The resident code
occupies 40-55K bytes depending
on configuration;
system data also occupies 30-55K bytes.
.SH
C.  Software
.PP
Most of the programs available as
.UC "UNIX/32V"
commands are listed.
Source code and printed manuals are 
distributed for all of the listed software
except games.
Almost all of the code is written in C.
Commands are self-contained and do not require extra setup
information,
unless specifically noted as ``interactive.''
Interactive programs can be made to run from a prepared script
simply by redirecting input.
Most programs intended for interactive use
(e.g., the editor) 
allow for an escape to
command level (the Shell).
Most file processing commands
can also go from standard input to standard output
(``filters'').
The piping facility of the Shell may be used
to connect such filters directly to the input or output
of other programs.
.NH
Basic Software
.PP
This
includes the time-sharing operating
system with utilities, and a 
compiler for the programming language C\(emenough
software to
write and run new applications
and to maintain or modify
.UC "UNIX/32V"
itself.
.NH 2
Operating System
.sh UNIX
The basic resident code
on which everything else depends.
Supports the system calls, and maintains the file system.
A general description of
.UC UNIX
design
philosophy and system facilities appeared in
the Communications of the ACM, July, 1974.
A more extensive survey is in the Bell System Technical Journal
for July-August 1978.
Capabilities include:
.op
Reentrant code for user processes.
.op
``Group'' access permissions for cooperative projects,
with overlapping memberships.
.op
Alarm-clock timeouts.
.op
Timer-interrupt sampling and interprocess monitoring
for debugging and measurement.
.OP
Multiplexed I/O for machine-to-machine communication.
.sh DEVICES
All I/O is logically synchronous.
I/O devices are simply files in the file system.
Normally, invisible buffering makes all physical
record structure and device characteristics transparent and exploits the
hardware's ability to do overlapped I/O.
Unbuffered physical record
I/O is available for unusual applications.
Drivers for these devices are
available:
.op
Asynchronous interfaces: DZ11, DL11.
Support for most common ASCII terminals.
.op
Automatic calling unit interface: DN11.
.op
Printer/plotter: Versatek.
.op
Magnetic tape: TE16.
.op
Pack type disk: RP06, RM03;
minimum-latency seek scheduling.
.op
Physical memory of VAX-11, or mapped memory in resident system.
.op
Null device.
.op
Recipies are supplied to aid the construction of drivers for:
.nf
.in +2
Asynchronous interface: DH11.
Synchronous interface: DU11.
DECtape: TC11.
Fixed head disk: RS11, RS03 and RS04.
Cartridge-type disk: RK05.
Phototypesetter: Graphic Systems System/1 through DR11C.
