This document contains instructions for the
installation and operation of the
\*(4B release of
.UX
as distributed by The University of California at Berkeley
for the Tahoe (CCI Power 6/32 and similar machines).
.PP
It discusses procedures for installing UNIX on a new machine,
and for upgrading an existing 4.2BSD Tahoe UNIX system to the new release.
An explanation of how to lay out file systems on available disks,
how to set up terminal lines and user accounts,
and how to do system-specific tailoring is provided.
A description of how to install and configure the networking
facilities included with \*(4B is included.
Finally, the document details system operation procedures:
shutdown and startup,
hardware error reporting and diagnosis, file system backup procedures,
resource control, performance monitoring, and procedures for recompiling
and reinstalling system software.
