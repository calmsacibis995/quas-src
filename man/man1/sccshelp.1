.sh NAME
sccshelp \*- ask for help
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bd sccshelp
[arg]~...
.sh DESCRIPTION
.it Sccshelp
finds information to explain a message from an SCCS command or explain the use
of a command.
Zero or more arguments may be supplied.
If no arguments are given,
.it sccshelp
will prompt for one.
.s1
The arguments may be either
message numbers (which normally appear in parentheses following messages)
or command names,
of one of the following types:
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~1	Begins with non-numerics, ends in numerics.
The non-numeric prefix is usually an abbreviation for the program or
set of routines which produced the message
(e.g., ``ge6'', for message 6 from the
.it get
command).
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~2	Does not contain numerics (as a command, such as
.it get
)
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~3	Is all numeric (e.g., ``212'')
.i0
.s1
The response of the program will be the explanatory information related
to the argument, if there is any.
.s1
When all else fails, try ``sccshelp stuck''.
.sh FILES
The ASCII file searched for the explanatory information
for each type of argument is as follows:
.s1
.lp +20 10
.if n type~1	/usr/lib/help/``prefix-of-argument''
.if t type~1	/usr/lib/help/\fIprefix-of-argument\fR
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~2	/usr/lib/help/cmds
.s1
.lp +20 10
type~3	/usr/lib/sccs.hf
.i0
.s1
If the file to be searched for either a type 1 or a type 2
argument does not exist, the search will be attempted on the
file for the type 3 argument.
In no case, however, will more than one file be searched per argument.
.s1
Anyone wishing to modify the files should list out portions
of them \*- the format will be obvious.
.sh DIAGNOSTICS

.it sccshelp
for help.
