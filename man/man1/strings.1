.SH NAME
strings \- find the printable strings in a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B strings
[
.B \-ao

\fB\-\fInumber\fR
] [ file ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIStrings\fP looks for ascii strings in each of the specified files,
or from the standard input.  A string is any sequence of 4 or more printing
characters.  Unless the \fB-a\fP flag is given, \fIstrings\fP only looks
in the initialized data space of object files.  If the \fB-o\fP flag is
given, then each string is preceded by its decimal offset in the file.
If the \fB-\fInumber\fR flag is given, then \fInumber\fP is used as the
minimum string length rather than 4.
.PP
\fIStrings\fP is useful for identifying random object files and
many other things.
