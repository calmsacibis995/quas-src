.SH NAME
tcopy \- copy and/or verify mag tapes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tcopy
[ -cv ] [ -s maxblk ] [src [ dest ]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fITcopy\fP is designed to copy magnetic tapes.  The only assumption made
about the tape is that there are two tape marks at the end.  \fITcopy\fP
with only a source tape (\fBrmt0\fP by default) specified will print
information about the sizes of records and tape files.  If a destination
is specified a copy will be made of the source tape.  The blocking on the
destination tape will be identical to that used on the source tape.  Copying
a tape will yield the same output as if just printing the sizes.
.PP
The \fB-s\fP option allows you to specify a maximum block size.  The \fB-v\fP
option verifies that two tapes are identical.  The \fB-c\fP option does
the copy and then verifies that the two tapes are identical.
