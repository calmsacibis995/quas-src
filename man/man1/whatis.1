.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIWhatis\fP looks up a given command and gives the header line from the
manual page.  You can then use the \fIman\fP(1) command to get more
information.
.PP
Normally \fIwhatis\fP checks in a standard location (/usr/man) for its
database ``whatis''.  This can be changed by supplying a \fIpath\fP (a
la the Bourne shell) with the \fB-M\fP flag.  This search path must be
a colon (``:'') separated list of directories which \fIwhatis\fP will
search for files named ``whatis''.  The path can also be set with the
environmental variable \fIMANPATH\fP.
