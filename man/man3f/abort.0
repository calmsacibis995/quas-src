NAME
     abort - abnormal termination

SYNOPSIS
     subroutine abort (string)
     character*(*) string

DESCRIPTION
     _A_b_o_r_t cleans up the I/O buffers and then terminates execu-
     tion.  If _s_t_r_i_n_g is given, it is written to logical unit 0
     preceded by ``abort:''.

     If the -g flag was specified during loading, then execution
     is terminated by calling _a_b_o_r_t (3) which aborts producing a
     _c_o_r_e file in the current directory.  If -g was not specified
     while loading, then *** _E_x_e_c_u_t_i_o_n _t_e_r_m_i_n_a_t_e_d is written on
     logical unit 0 and execution is terminated.

     If the _f_7_7__d_u_m_p__f_l_a_g environment variable has been set to a
     value which begins with _y, _a_b_o_r_t (3) is called whether or
     not -g was specified during loading.  Similarly, if the
     value of _f_7_7__d_u_m_p__f_l_a_g begins with _n, _a_b_o_r_t is not called.
