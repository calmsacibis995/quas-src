NAME
     etime, dtime - return elapsed execution time

SYNOPSIS
     function etime (tarray)
     real tarray(2)

     function dtime (tarray)
     real tarray(2)

DESCRIPTION
     These two routines return elapsed runtime in seconds for the
     calling process.  _D_t_i_m_e returns the elapsed time since the
     last call to _d_t_i_m_e, or the start of execution on the first
     call.

     The argument array returns user time in the first element
     and system time in the second element.  The function value
     is the sum of user and system time.

     The resolution of all timing is 1/HZ sec. where HZ is
     currently 60.
