NAME
     exit - terminate process with status

SYNOPSIS
     subroutine exit (status)
     integer status

DESCRIPTION
     _E_x_i_t flushes and closes all the process's files, and noti-
     fies the parent process if it is executing a _w_a_i_t.  The
     low-order 8 bits of _s_t_a_t_u_s are available to the parent pro-
     cess.  (Therefore _s_t_a_t_u_s should be in the range 0 - 255)

     This call will never return.

     The C function _e_x_i_t may cause cleanup actions before the
     final `sys exit'.

FILES
     /usr/lib/libF77.a
