GETC(3F)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		 GETC(3F)



NAME
     getc, fgetc - get a character from a logical unit

SYNOPSIS
     integer function getc (char)
     character char

     integer function fgetc (lunit, char)
     character char

DESCRIPTION
     These routines return the next character from a file associ-
     ated with a fortran logical unit, bypassing normal fortran
     I/O.  _G_e_t_c reads from logical unit 5, normally connected to
     the control terminal input.

     The value of each function is a system status code. Zero
     indicates no error occurred on the read; -1 indicates end of
     file was detected.  A positive value will be either a UNIX
     system error code or an f77 I/O error code. See perror(3F).

FILES
     /usr/lib/libU77.a
