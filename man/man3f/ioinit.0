NAME
     ioinit - change f77 I/O initialization

SYNOPSIS
     logical function ioinit (cctl, bzro, apnd, prefix, vrbose)
     logical cctl, bzro, apnd, vrbose
     character*(*) prefix

DESCRIPTION
     This routine will initialize several global parameters in
     the f77 I/O system, and attach externally defined files to
     logical units at run time.  The effect of the flag arguments
     applies to logical units opened after _i_o_i_n_i_t is called.  The
     exception is the preassigned units, 5 and 6, to which _c_c_t_l
     and _b_z_r_o will apply at any time.  _I_o_i_n_i_t is written in
     Fortran-77.

     By default, carriage control is not recognized on any logi-
     cal unit. If _c_c_t_l is .true. then carriage control will be
     recognized on formatted output to all logical units except
     unit 0, the diagnostic channel.  Otherwise the default will
     be restored.

     By default, trailing and embedded blanks in input data
     fields are ignored. If _b_z_r_o is .true. then such blanks will
     be treated as zeros.  Otherwise the default will be
     restored.

     By default, all files opened for sequential access are posi-
     tioned at their beginning.  It is sometimes necessary or
     convenient to open at the END-OF-FILE so that a write will
     append to the existing data.  If _a_p_n_d is .true. then files
     opened subsequently on any logical unit will be positioned
     at their end upon opening.  A value of .false. will restore
     the default behavior.

     _I_o_i_n_i_t may be used to associate file names with Fortran log-
     ical unit numbers through environment variables (see "Intro-
     duction to the f77 I/O Library" for a more general way of
     doing this).  If the argument _p_r_e_f_i_x is a non-blank string,
     then names of the form prefixNN will be sought in the pro-
     gram environment. The value associated with each such name
     found will be used to open logical unit NN for formatted
     sequential access.  For example, if f77 program _m_y_p_r_o_g_r_a_m
     included the call

	  call ioinit (.true., .false., .false., 'FORT', .false.)

     then when the following sequence

	   % setenv FORT01 mydata
	   % setenv FORT12 myresults

IOINIT(3F)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       IOINIT(3F)



	   % myprogram

     would result in logical unit 1 opened to file _m_y_d_a_t_a and
     logical unit 12 opened to file _m_y_r_e_s_u_l_t_s.	Both files would
     be positioned at their beginning.	Any formatted output
     would have column 1 removed and interpreted as carriage con-
     trol.  Embedded and trailing blanks would be ignored on
     input.

     If the argument _v_r_b_o_s_e is .true. then _i_o_i_n_i_t will report on
     its activity.

     The effect of

	  call ioinit (.true., .true., .false., '', .false.)

     can be achieved without the actual call by including
     ``-lI66'' on the _f_7_7 command line.  This gives carriage con-
     trol on all logical units except 0, causes files to be
     opened at their beginning, and causes blanks to be inter-
     preted as zero's.

     The internal flags are stored in a labeled common block with
     the following definition:

	  integer*2 ieof, ictl, ibzr
	  common /ioiflg/ ieof, ictl, ibzr


FILES

     Library''

BUGS
     _P_r_e_f_i_x can be no longer than 30 characters.  A pathname
     associated with an environment name can be no longer than
     255 characters.

     The ``+'' carriage control does not work.
