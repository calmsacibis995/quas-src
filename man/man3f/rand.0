RAND(3F)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		 RAND(3F)



NAME
     rand, drand, irand - return random values

SYNOPSIS
     function irand (iflag)

     function rand (iflag)

     double precision function drand (iflag)

DESCRIPTION
     The newer random(3f) should be used in new applications;
     rand remains for compatibilty.

     These functions use _r_a_n_d(3C) to generate sequences of random
     numbers.  If _i_f_l_a_g is '1', the generator is restarted and
     the first random value is returned.  If _i_f_l_a_g is otherwise
     non-zero, it is used as a new seed for the random number
     generator, and the first new random value is returned.

     _I_r_a_n_d returns positive integers in the range 0 through
     2147483647.  _R_a_n_d and _d_r_a_n_d return values in the range 0.
     through 1.0 .

BUGS
     The algorithm returns a 15 bit quantity on the PDP11; a 31
     bit quantity on the VAX.  _I_r_a_n_d on the PDP11 calls _r_a_n_d(3C)
     twice to form a 31 bit quantity, but bit 15 will always be
     0.
