RENAME(3F)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	       RENAME(3F)



NAME
     rename - rename a file

SYNOPSIS
     integer function rename (from, to)
     character*(*) from, to

DESCRIPTION
     _F_r_o_m must be the pathname of an existing file.  _T_o will
     become the new pathname for the file.  If _t_o exists, then
     both _f_r_o_m and _t_o must be the same type of file, and must
     reside on the same filesystem.  If _t_o exists, it will be
     removed first.

     The returned value will be 0 if successful; a system error
     code otherwise.

FILES
     /usr/lib/libU77.a

SEE ALSO
     rename(2), perror(3F)

BUGS
     Pathnames can be no longer than MAXPATHLEN as defined in
     <_s_y_s/_p_a_r_a_m._h>.
