.SH NAME
mpcctab \- MPCC configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The file \fBmpcctab\fR is used to configure CCI's Multi-Protocol 
Communication Controller (MPCC).
The controller provides high-speed
synchronous communications for the \s-1POWER 6\s+1 family
of computers.
This file determines the MPCC board 
configurations. You can download either a synchronous , bisync or
an asynchronous protocol to an MPCC board.
See \fIdlmpcc\fR(8)
for details.
.LP
A \fBmpcctab\fR file is supplied
with each MPCC release; however, 
you can modify this file or create your own file 
by using one of the \s-1UNIX\s+1 text editors.
.LP
The contents of the file 
consists of entries that describe supported communication 
protocols and their unique attributes. The protocols supported are
X.25, SNA,  ASYNC, and BISYNC.
For ASYNC two different entries are possible in the 
\fIprocol\fR field - if 16 port MPCC async is configured, then ASYNC is 
entered; 32 port MPCC async is specified by entering 32PORT.
This file must reside in the directory
\fB/etc/mpcc\fR. 
.SH Entry Line Format
An entry line consists of an \fIitem identifier\fR followed by 
variable width arguments separated by colons. There are three 
item identifiers: MPCC, PROTOCOL, PORT. The MPCC line in this file
identifies the board number. The PROTOCOL line identifies
the specific communication protocol.
The PORT line describes
the port for the immediately preceding protocol. The number
of arguments  for the PROTOCOL and PORT lines,
and the arguments themselves, 
are protocol dependent. See the individual
argument descriptions for details.
.LP
Notes: Use upper case letters for clarity when specifying the item 
identifier and the protocol name. Make sure that you enter
the argument values in the order specified below. Also, use comments 
liberally, and indicate comment lines by placing a 
pound sign (\fB#\fR) in column one. 
.LP
The item identifiers and their corresponding line
formats, with valid argument values, follow:

Argument Explanations: 
.RS
.IP \fIbdno\fR 8
Specifies the board number.
.IP \fBFCCS\fR 8
FCCS is a fault-tolerant support system that allows backup ports
to assume the functions of failed ports.
For example,
if port 0 fails for any reason,
another port may be configured to assume the duties of the failed port.
The keyword \fBFCCS\fR identifies this feature and must be
followed by the list of fail-safe port numbers and a time increment,
described below.
This feature is optional.
.IP \fBSOC\fR 8
An FCCS port can also be an SOC (Switch On Close) port,
meaning that the port will switch when it is closed.
And as with FCCS, the port will switch if it fails.
This feature is optional.
.IP \fIportno\fR 8
Portno is a list of port numbers,
separated by commas,
specifying the primary ports you want protected by backup ports.
FCCS boards have either 4 primary and 4 backup ports,
or 8 primary and 8 backup ports.
The valid port numbers are
.B 0
through
.B 3
for the 4-port version,
and
.B 0
through
.B 7
for the 8-port version.
.IP
Each of the ports has a switched connector.
If the board fails for any reason,
the traffic on these ports is automatically routed
through the switched connector.
These connectors must be cabled to secondary ports on the other FCCS
connector panels.
The secondary ports are numbered 8 through 11 on the 4-port version and
8 through 15 on the 8-port version.
Only the primary ports need be designated in the FCCS configuration line,
however all ports must be identified as described in the PORT Line section
below.
.if n .bp
.IP \fItime\fR 8
Specifies the time period for the sentinel relay timer. 
Each board resets its sentinel timer after the specified
time period. If the
board fails, and therefore can't set the timer, then control
is passed automatically to another board, which continues 
the current processing. This feature ensures PerpetualProcessing
and is transparent to the user. The valid range of values
in milliseconds is from \fB50\fR to \fB5950\fR in 
50 millisecond increments.

board specified in the previous \fBMPCC\fR line. 
.IP \fIdepargs\fR 10
Specifies the protocol-dependent protocol attributes. X.25  and SNA have ten (10)
arguments,
ASYNC has just one (1) argument, and BISYNC has no arguments.

Note: You must be familiar with the 
X.25 CCITT Yellow Book (1980) 
in order to understand the following values.

.IP \fIK\fR 8
Specifies the Level 2 window size.
.if n .bp
.IP \fIxid1\fR 8
Specifies the destination type in the XID command. It must be a number
from 1-5:
.nf

        1 = AXE
        2 = CTSS
        3 = DEX
