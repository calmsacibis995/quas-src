.SH NAME
mt \- UNIX magtape interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
The files
.I "cy0s, ..., cy15s"
refer to the UNIX magtape drives,
which may be on the VERSABUS using the CIPHER tapemaster formatter
.IR cy (4),
The following description applies to any of the transport/controller pairs.
The files
.I "cy0s, ..., cy15s"
are read/written in 25ips, 
The density (1600 bpi or 3200 bpi) is selected by a switch on the drive.
The files
.I "cy0s, ..., cy7s"
are rewound when closed.
The non-rewinding files are named
.I ncy[0-7]
respectively.
.PP
For compatibility, the
.I [n]cy*s
files are linked to appropriate
.I [n]mt*
files.
.PP
When a file open for writing is closed, two file-marks are written.
If the tape is not to be rewound
it is positioned with the head between the two
file-marks.
.PP
A standard tape consists of a
series of 1024 byte records terminated by two
file-marks.
To the extent possible, the system makes
it possible, if inefficient, to treat
the tape like any other file.
Seeks have their usual meaning and it is possible
to read or write a byte at a time.
.PP
The
.I mt
files discussed above are useful
when it is desired to access the tape in a way
compatible with ordinary files.
When foreign tapes are to be dealt with, and especially
when long records are to be read or written, the
`raw' interface is appropriate.
Writing in very small units is inadvisable,
however, because it tends to create monstrous record
gaps.  The associated files are named
.I "rcy0s, ..., rcy15s,"
but the same minor-device considerations as for the regular files still apply,
as well as the appropriate
.I r[n]mt*
links.
.PP
A number of other ioctl operations are available
on raw magnetic tape.
The following definitions are from <sys/mtio.h>:

.PP
Each
.I read
or
.I write
call reads or writes the next record on the tape.
In the write case the record has the same length as the
buffer given.
During a read, the record size is passed
back as the number of bytes read, provided it is no greater
than the buffer size;
if the record is long, an error is indicated.
In raw tape I/O seeks are ignored.
A zero byte count is returned when a tape mark is read,
but another read will fetch the first record of the
new tape file.
