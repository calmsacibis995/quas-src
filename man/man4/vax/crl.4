.SH NAME
crl \- VAX 8600 console RL02 interface
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a simple interface to the DEC RL02
disk unit which is part of the console
subsystem on the VAX 8600 and 8650.
Access is given to the entire
RL02 disk; the pack format is the same
as that of RL02 disks on other controllers.
As on other VAX console media, transfers are done a word at a time
using privileged registers (i.e., slowly).
.PP
All I/O is raw; the seek addresses in raw transfers should be a multiple
of 512 bytes and a multiple of 512 bytes should be transferred,
as in other ``raw'' disk interfaces.
(Although the sector size is actually 256 bytes, the driver allows
operations only on 512-byte boundaries.)
