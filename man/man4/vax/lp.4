.SH NAME
lp \- line printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "device lp0 at uba0 csr 0177514 vector lpintr"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Lp
provides the interface to any of the standard
DEC line printers on an LP-11 parallel interface.
When it is opened or closed, a suitable number
of page ejects is generated.
Bytes written are printed.
.PP
The unit number of the printer is specified by the minor device
after removing the low 3 bits, which act as per-device parameters.
Currently only the lowest of the low three bits is interpreted:
if it is set, the device is treated as having a 64-character set,
rather than a full 96-character set.
In the resulting half-ASCII mode, lower case letters are turned
into upper case and certain characters are escaped according to
the following table:

The driver correctly interprets
carriage returns, backspaces, tabs, and form feeds.
Lines longer than the maximum page width are truncated.
The default page width is 132 columns.
This may be overridden by specifying, for example, ``flags 256'' .
