.SH NAME
mtab \- mounted file system table
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "#include <fstab.h>
.br
.B "#include <mtab.h>"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mtab
resides in directory
.I /etc
and contains a table of devices mounted by the
.I mount
command.
.I Umount
removes entries.
.PP
The table is a series of
.I mtab
structures, as defined in
.IR < mtab.h >.
Each entry contains the null-padded name of
the place where the special file is mounted,
the null-padded name of the special file, and
a type field, one of those defined in
.RI < fstab.h >.
The special file has all its directories
stripped away;
that is, everything through the last `/' is thrown
away.  The type field indicates if the file system
is mounted read-only, read-write, or read-write with
disk quotas enabled.
.PP
This table is present only so people can look at it.
It does not matter to
.I mount
if there are duplicated entries nor
to
.I umount
if a name cannot be found.
