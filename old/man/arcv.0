NAME
     arcv - convert archives to new format

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/arcv file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _A_r_c_v converts archive files (see _a_r(1), _a_r(5)) from 32v and
     Third Berkeley editions to a new portable format.	The
     conversion is done in place, and the command refuses to
     alter a file not in old archive format.

     Old archives are marked with a magic number of 0177545 at
     the start; new archives have a first line ``!<arch>''.

FILES
     /tmp/v*, temporary copy
