NAME
     net - execute a command on a remote machine

SYNOPSIS
     net [ -m machine ] [ -l login ] [ -p password ] [ -r
     respfile ] [ - ] [ -f ] [ -n ] [ -q ] command

DESCRIPTION
     The _n_e_t command sends the specified _c_o_m_m_a_n_d (which should be
     enclosed in quotes) over the network to the specified (or
     default) remote machine.  The network will notify the user
     when the command has been executed and will return to him
     any output or error indication by `writing' (see _w_r_i_t_e(1))
     to the terminal if he is still logged in, or `mailing' (see
     _m_a_i_l(1)) otherwise.

     There are a number of options, which must precede the com-
     mand.  Options may be specified on the command line, preced-
     ing the command, or in a file ``.netrc'' in the user's login
     directory.  The ``.netrc'' file is not described here.  The
     -m option specifies the desired remote machine.  If a remote
     machine is not specified, the default one is used.  The
     machine name may be a one letter abbreviation or a full
     name; upper- and lower-case distinctions are ignored.  If
     the standard output and standard error files are to be
     saved, the -r option returns to the originating user a file
     (_r_e_s_p_f_i_l_e) containing the standard output and error files
     when the command was executed on the remote machine.  If
     this option is used, no message is written back.  The pres-
     ence of a non-zero length _r_e_s_p_f_i_l_e indicates completion.
     The -q option suppresses all acknowledgements unless an
     error occurs, there is output from the command, or the exit
     code of _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is non-zero.

     If the -l and -p options are not specified, and the login
     name and password are not in the ``.netrc'' file, a remote
     login name and password is prompted for on the terminal; the
     -f flag forces login name and password prompting.	A single
     - indicates that the standard input from the local machine
     is to be taken and transmitted to the remote machine, where
     it will be the standard input for _c_o_m_m_a_n_d. The -n flag
     forces all acknowledgment and output messages to be mailed
     rather than written on the terminal.  Options do not need to
     be separated by spaces, i.e. either ``-m C'' or ``-mC'' is
     accepted.	There are also other options intended to be used
     by higher level application programs and shell scripts only;
     they will not be described here.

     The net command prepares a file to be sent to the remote
     machine and queues it in the `network queue.' _N_e_t_q (1) gives
     information about the queues.
