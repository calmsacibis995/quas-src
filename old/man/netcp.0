NAME
     netcp - remote copy of files through the net

SYNOPSIS
     netcp [ -l login ] [ -p password ] [ -f ] [ -n ] [ -q ]
     fromfile tofile

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_c_p copies files between machines and is similar to _c_p(1).
     At least one of _f_r_o_m_f_i_l_e and _t_o_f_i_l_e must be remote.  The -l,
     -p, -f, -q, and -n behave exactly as in _n_e_t(1).

     _F_r_o_m_f_i_l_e and _t_o_f_i_l_e follow these conventions:

     1.  A simple filename is assumed to be local and from the
	 current directory.

     2.  A filename preceded by a machine designator (see below)
	 is a reference to a file on the specified remote
	 machine.  If a full pathname is not given, it is assumed
	 to be from the login directory.

     Examples:

	 grades.p	 file in the current directory on local
			 machine

	 C:junk          file in your login directory on C

	 /usr/lib/pq	 file on local machine

	 C:comp/c2.c	 file in a subdirectory on C machine

     When files are being ``fetched'', that is, the _f_r_o_m_f_i_l_e is
     remote and the _t_o_f_i_l_e is local, the _t_o_f_i_l_e is created zero-
     length mode 600.  For security reasons, when the ``fetched''
     file's contents arrive at the local machine, the file must
     still be zero-length and mode 0600.  No confirmation is sent
     to the user that the file has been ``fetched''; a non-zero
     file length indicates completion.

     _N_e_t_c_p executes the _n_e_t(1) command.

     as in _c_p(1), it must be given explicitly.
     The file mode may or may not be set correctly.
