NAME
     netlogin - provide login name and password for a remote
     machine

SYNOPSIS
     netlogin -m machine [ -l login ]

DESCRIPTION
     The _n_e_t_l_o_g_i_n command sets the login name and password for
     the specified _m_a_c_h_i_n_e in a rather unusual way.  The user
     should type (to the C shell)

	  setenv MACH_m_a_c_h_i_n_e `netlogin -m _m_a_c_h_i_n_e`

     or (to the default Version 7 ``Bourne'' shell)

	  MACH_m_a_c_h_i_n_e=`netlogin -m _m_a_c_h_i_n_e`; export MACH_m_a_c_h_i_n_e

     to his login shell.  (Note the back-quotes).  For example,

	  setenv MACHA `netlogin -m A`

     will prompt the user for his login name and password on the
     A machine and

	  setenv MACHA `netlogin -m A -l myname`

     will prompt the user for the password to account `A:myname'.

     The _n_e_t(1) command will read the environment looking for
     environment variables beginning with ``MACH'' and followed
     by a valid machine name on the local network.  If found it
     will use that information rather than prompt the user every
     time he executes a network command.  This environment infor-
     mation is ignored if login names and passwords are specified
     on the command line of network commands using the -l and -p
     options or in the ._n_e_t_r_c file.

     This procedure for specifying passwords is somewhat safer
     than putting the remote passwords in the ._n_e_t_r_c file.  The
     passwords in the environment are encrypted and the environ-
     ment information is useless after the user logs out.  Use
     the _p_r_i_n_t_e_n_v(1) command to see the encrypted password.
