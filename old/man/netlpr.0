NETLPR(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual		NETLPR(1)



NAME
     netlpr - use a remote lineprinter through the net

SYNOPSIS
     netlpr [ -m machine ] [ -l login ] [ -p password ] [ -f ] [
     -q ] [ -n ] [ -c command ] [ name1 ... namen ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_l_p_r sends the named files, (or the standard input if none
     are named), to a remote lineprinter; the -m option forces
     the files to be printed on the specified machine.	(If not
     specified, the default machine is used.) The -l, -p, -f, -q,
     and -n options behave exactly as in _n_e_t(1).  If the -c
     option is specified, the _c_o_m_m_a_n_d is used in place of `lpr'.
     This allows the use of different lineprinters on the remote
     machine.  See the file `/_u_s_r/_n_e_t/_n_e_t_w_o_r_k._m_a_p' for a list of
     available commands.  Any other options are passed through to
     _l_p_r(1) on the remote machine.  Copies of the files are not
     made on the remote machine.

     _N_e_t_l_p_r executes the _n_e_t(1) command.

FILES
     /usr/net/network.map     lists the allowed local printer
     names
