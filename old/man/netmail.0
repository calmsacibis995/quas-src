NAME
     netmail - read mail on a remote machine over the network

SYNOPSIS
     netmail [ -l username ] [ -p password ] [ -c ] [ -q ] [ -n ]
     [ -f ] [ machine:username ]

DESCRIPTION
     Mail is checked and/or read on the specified _m_a_c_h_i_n_e. If the
     machine specification is omitted, the default machine is
     used.  The command has two distinct modes depending on
     whether the -c option is specified.

     If -c is specified, the presence of mail is checked on the
     remote machine.  No password is required so it can be put in
     C shell `.netrc' file.  A message is written or mailed back
     (see _n_e_t(1)) if there is or is not any unread mail.

     If the -c option is not specified, mail is read and mailed
     back to the user.	A password is required.  Mail is also
     appended to the remote file `_m_b_o_x' as a precaution.

     The -q option suppresses the message sent back if there is
     no mail.  The options -l, -p, -f, and -n behave exactly as
     in _n_e_t(1).  (The login name can be specified either with the
     -l option or by `machine:username'.)

     _N_e_t_m_a_i_l executes the _n_e_t(1) command.

     Examples:

	 netmail -c X:uname	   checks if there is mail for
				   `uname' on the X machine, no
				   password required.

	 netmail X:uname	   reads mail for `uname' on the
				   X machine, mails it back,
				   password is required.
