NAME
     netq - print contents of network queue

SYNOPSIS
     netq [ -a ] [ machine ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_q lists the contents of the network queue, one request
     per line, for each directly-connected machine.  For each
     request, it shows the login name and machine of the origina-
     tor, the destination machine and login name, and the length
     (in bytes) of the request (this will be larger than any
     files transferred (e.g. by _n_e_t_c_p), because of header infor-
     mation).  Also described are the queue filename which may be
     used as an argument to _n_e_t_r_m(1), the time entered the queue,
     and the command being sent.

     _N_e_t_q summarizes requests by other users.  If the -a option
     is specified, requests from all users are listed.

     If a _m_a_c_h_i_n_e is specified, only the queue for that
     directly-connected machine is listed.

     The requests are listed in the order they will be sent; the
     queue for each machine is totally independent from the other
     machine's queues.

BUGS
     _N_e_t_q should also list files in net queues on intermediate
     machines.
     The commands are sent shortest-job first.	There is no way
     to delay a shorter, earlier request.
