NAME
     netrm - remove a command from the network queue

SYNOPSIS
     netrm [ - ] [ name1 ... namen ]

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_r_m removes files from the network queue which have been
     queued for transmission to remote machines (but not yet
     sent).  The _n_a_m_e_s specified are the filenames reported by
     the _n_e_t_q(1) command.  The - option indicates that all files
     owned by the person logged in are to be removed.

     Only the owner of the file or super-user can _n_e_t_r_m the file.

FILES
     /usr/spool/berknet/send? the directories where the queues
     are

BUGS
     Files on network queues on intermediate machines cannot be
     removed.
     There should be a -m flag to use with - to remove all your
     requests to one particular machine.
