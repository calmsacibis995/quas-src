NETTROFF(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	      NETTROFF(1)



NAME
     nettroff - troff to the phototypesetter over the network

SYNOPSIS
     nettroff troff arguments

DESCRIPTION
     _N_e_t_t_r_o_f_f runs _t_r_o_f_f(1) and sends the output over the network
     to the machine at the Computer Center with the photo-
     typesetter (currently the ``A'' machine.) It will prompt you
     for an account name and password on the A machine unless you
     have provided these in your ._n_e_t_r_c file.  The _t_r_o_f_f -s
     option is unnecessary and not permitted.

     _N_e_t_t_r_o_f_f jobs are limited to 15 feet of typesetter output.
     It is also a good idea to limit the size of the individual
     files sent, as the network uses a shortest-job-first
     scheduling algorithm.  Jobs of 25000 characters or less are
     preferable; in no case will the network accept jobs longer
     than 100000 characters.

BUGS
     There is no way to specify special font mounts on the A
     machine.
     The -l and -p options of the _n_e_t(1) command may not be
     specified.
     This command is not supported by the Computer Center.
     If on a Computer Center machine (B, C, D, or E) use the
     _t_r_o_f_f command (see _t_r_o_f_f(1)) for more information.
