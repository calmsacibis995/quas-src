NAME
     trman - translate version 6 manual macros to version 7 mac-
     ros

SYNOPSIS
     trman [ file  ]

DESCRIPTION
     _T_r_m_a_n reads the input file, which should be nroff/troff
     input and attempts to translate the version 6 manual sec-
     tions therein to version 7 format.  It is largely success-
     ful, but seems to have trouble with indented paragraphs and
     complicated font control.	You should expect to have to fix
     up long sections by hand somewhat.
