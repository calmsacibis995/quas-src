NAME
     ttytype - data base of terminal types by port

SYNOPSIS
     /etc/ttytype

DESCRIPTION
     _T_t_y_t_y_p_e is a database containing, for each tty port on the
     system, the kind of terminal that is attached to it.  There
     is one line per port, containing the terminal kind (as a
     name listed in termcap (5)), a space, and the name of the
     tty, minus /dev/.

     This information is read by _t_s_e_t(1) and by _l_o_g_i_n(1) to ini-
     tialize the TERM variable at login time.

SEE ALSO

BUGS
     Some lines are merely known as "dialup" or "plugboard".
