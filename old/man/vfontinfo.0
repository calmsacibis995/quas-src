VFONTINFO(1)	    UNIX Programmer's Manual	     VFONTINFO(1)



NAME
     vfontinfo - inspect and print out information about UNIX
     fonts

SYNOPSIS
     vfontinfo [ -v ] fontname [ characters ]

DESCRIPTION
     _V_f_o_n_t_i_n_f_o allows you to examine a font in the UNIX format.
     It prints out all the information in the font header and
     information about every non-null (width > 0) glyph.  This
     can be used to make sure the font is consistent with the
     format.

     The _f_o_n_t_n_a_m_e argument is the name of the font you wish to
     inspect.  It writes to standard output.  If it can't find
     the file in your working directory, it looks in
     /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_v_f_o_n_t (the place most of the fonts are kept).

     The _c_h_a_r_a_c_t_e_r_s, if given, specify certain characters to
     show.  If omitted, the entire font is shown.

     If the -v (verbose) flag is used, the bits of the glyph
     itself are shown as an array of X's and spaces, in addition
     to the header information.
