NAME
     vpr, vprm, vpq, vprint - raster printer/plotter spooler

SYNOPSIS
     vpr [ -W ] [ -l ] [ -v ] [ -t [ -1234 font ] ] [ -w ] [
     -w_w_i_d_t_h ] [ -m ] [ name ... ]
     vprm [ id ...  ] [ filename ...  ] [ owner ...  ]
     vpq
     vprint [ -W ] file ...

DESCRIPTION
     _V_p_r causes the named files to be queued for printing or
     typeset simulation on one of the available raster
     printer/plotters.	If no files are named, the standard input
     is read.  By default the input is assumed to be line
     printer-like text.  For very wide plotters, the input is run
     through the filter /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_s_i_d_e_b_y_s_i_d_e giving it an argument
     of -w106 which arranges it four pages adjacent with 90
     column lines (the rest is for the left margin).  Since there
     are 8 lines per inch in the default printer font, _v_p_r thus
     produces 86 lines per page (the top and bottom lines are
     left blank).

     The following options are available:

     -l             Print the input in a more literal manner.
		    Page breaks are not inserted, and most con-
		    trol characters (except format effectors: \n,
		    \f, etc.) are printed (many control charac-
		    ters print special graphics not in the ASCII
		    character set.) Tab and underline processing
		    is still done.  If this option is not given,
		    control characters which are not format
		    effectors are ignored, and page breaks are
		    inserted after an appropriate number of lines
		    have been printed on a page.

     -W             Queues files for printing on a wide output
		    device, if available.  Normally, files are
		    queued for printing on a narrow output dev-
		    ice.

     -1234	    Specifies a font to be mounted on font posi-
		    tion _i.  The daemon will construct a ._r_a_i_l_m_a_g
		    file referencing /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_v_f_o_n_t/_n_a_m_e._s_i_z_e.

     -m             Report by _m_a_i_l(1) when printing is complete.

     -w             (Applicable only to wide output devices.) Do
		    not run the input through sidebyside.  Such
		    processing has been done already, or full
		    (440 character) printer width is desired.

     -w_w_i_d_t_h	    Use width _w_i_d_t_h rather than 90 for _s_i_d_e_b_y_-
		    _s_i_d_e.

     -v             Use the filter /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_v_r_a_s_t to convert the
		    vectors to raster. The named files must be a
		    parameter and vector file (in that order)
		    created by _p_l_o_t(3X) routines.

     -t             Use the filter /_u_s_r/_l_i_b/_v_c_a_t to typeset the
		    input on the printer/plotter.  The input must
		    have been generated by _t_r_o_f_f(1) run with the
		    -t option.	This is not normally run directly
		    to wide output devices, since it is wasteful
		    to run only one page across.  The program
		    _v_t_r_o_f_f(1) is normally used and arranges,
		    using _v_s_o_r_t for printing to occur four pages
		    across, conserving paper.

     _V_p_r_m removes entries from the raster device queues.  The id,
     filename or owner should be that reported by _v_p_q. All
     appropriate files will be removed.  Both queues are always
     searched.	The id of each file removed from the queue will
     be printed.

     _V_p_q prints the queues.  Each entry in the queue is printed
     showing the owner of the queue entry, an identification
     number, the size of the entry in characters, and the file
     which is to be printed.  The _i_d is useful for removing a
     specific entry from the printer queue using _v_p_r_m

     _V_p_r_i_n_t is a shell script which _p_r'_s a copy of each named
     file on one of the electrostatic printer/plotters.  The
     files are normally printed on a narrow device; -W option
     causes them to be printed on a wide device.

BUGS
     The 1's (one's) and l's (lower-case el's) in a Benson-
     Varian's standard character set look very similar; caution
     is advised.

     A versatec's hardware character set is rather ugly.  _V_p_r_i_n_t
     should use one of the constant width fonts to produce pret-
     tier listings.
