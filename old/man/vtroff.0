NAME
     vtroff - troff to a raster plotter

SYNOPSIS
     vtroff [ -w ] [ -F majorfont ] [ -123 minorfont ] [ -l_l_e_n_g_t_h
     ] [ -x ] troff arguments

DESCRIPTION
     _V_t_r_o_f_f runs _t_r_o_f_f(1) sending its output through various pro-
     grams to produce typeset output on a raster plotter such as
     a Benson-Varian or or a Versatec.	The -W option specifies
     that a wide output device be used; the default is to use a
     narrow device.  The -l (lower case l) option causes the out-
     put to be split onto successive pages every _l_e_n_g_t_h inches
     rather than the default 11''.

     The default font is a Hershey font.  If some other font is
     desired you can give a -F argument and then the font name.
     This will place normal, italic and bold versions of the font
     on positions 1, 2, and 3.	To place a font only on a single
     position, you can give an argument of the form -_n and the
     minor font name.  A .r will be added to the minor font name
     if needed.  Thus ``vtroff -ms paper'' will set a paper in
     the Hershey font, while ``vtroff -F nonie -ms paper'' will
     set the paper in the (sans serif) nonie font.  The -x option
     asks for exact simulation of photo-typesetter output.  (I.e.
     using the width tables for the C.A.T. photo-typesetter)

FILES

BUGS
     Since some macro packages work correctly only if the fonts
     named R, I, B, and S are mounted, and since the Versatec
     fonts have different widths for individual characters than
     the fonts found on the typesetter, the following dodge was
     necessary: If you don't use the ``.fp'' troff directive then
     you get the widths of the standard typesetter fonts suitable
     for shipping the output of troff over the network to the
     computer center A machine for phototypesetting.  If, how-
     ever, you remount the R, I, B and S fonts, then you get the
     width tables for the Versatec.
