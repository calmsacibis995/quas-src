                          ABSTRACT

          This document briefly describes  the  changes
     to the Berkeley version of UNIX+ for the VAX| made
     by  Quasijarus  Project in each successive 4.3BSD-
     Quasijarus release up to the present.  It attempts
     only to summarize the major changes that have been
     made.  There are many more minor changes.



                4.3BSD-Quasijarus0a changes


o    SCCS commands are now part of the standard system.

o    The MicroVAX bootblock has been added to  the  standard
     distribution  tape.  Since it must reside at the begin-
     ning of the tape,  the  original  toggle-in  bootstraps
     have been moved two blocks down.

o    Franz Lisp has been separated from the main system.

o    Jean-loup Gailly's zlib compression library  (-lz)  has
     been included in the standard system.

o    -s option has been added to compress(1) to  use  strong
     compression  instead of the standard compress algorithm
     (also known as LZW).

o    Several new MSCP disks have been added to  the  distri-
     buted  /etc/disktab  and to the compiled-in disk tables
     in the uda(4) driver.

SMM:23-2          Bug Fixes and Changes in 4.3BSD-Quasijarus


o    Kdb(4) driver now uses the same partitions as uda(4) on
     the same disks.

o    The kernel and the standalone system have  been  taught
     that VAXBI KLESI (TU81 controller) is actually a UNIBUS
     adapter with a UNIBUS KLESI sitting  behind  it,  which
     DEC  apparently  doesn't  want  you  to know, instantly
     gaining full support for this device.

o    Added Makefile support for building a distribution con-
     sole  RL02 pack for VAX 8600 and 8650 machines, so that
     one can be supplied to sites cold-bootstrapping UNIX on
     such a machine.

o    The protocol used by dmc(4) and dmv(4) drivers has been
     standardized  to  MTU  of  1284  bytes, 8 garbage bytes
     present.  This is the protocol used 4.3BSD  dmc(4)  and
     Ultrix  dmc(4) and dmv(4), i.e., by all existing stable
     releases.

o    The  ``mini  root''  file  system  used  in  the   full
     bootstrap  procedure  has  been  increased  from 2 to 3
     megabytes.

o    The troff(1) sources for  the  supplementary  documents
     have been moved from /usr/doc to /usr/src/doc.

o    The system headers are now copied rather than symlinked
     from  /sys to /usr/include by default, so that the sys-
     tem can still be used operationally, including  compil-
     ing user programs when the sources are not installed.


                4.3BSD-Quasijarus0b changes


o    Y2K fixes throughout the system.

o    Fix for a critical bug in c2, the  peephole  optimiser,
     which  caused  it  under certain circumstances to throw
     out instructions loading  registers  which  were  later
     used  in  deferred  or  indexed  addressing modes.  The
     resulting misoptimised  code  thus  dereferenced  bogus
     addresses,   dumping   core  or  even  worse,  behaving
     unpredictably.  Many other minor bugs  have  also  been
     fixed  in  c2.   Since all system binaries are compiled
     with -O this potentially affects every  binary  in  the
     system.

o    As(1) now automatically chooses between byte  branches,
     word  branches,  and  long  jumps,  and  ignores the -J
     option.  It now also provides  relaxed  forms  of  SOB,
     AOB, and ACB instructions, which are now used by c2.

Bug Fixes and Changes in 4.3BSD-Quasijarus          SMM:23-3


o    Cc(1) -J option causes switch tables to be generated in
     long form like on Sun3.

o    A number of tables have been enlarged in the C compiler
     and preprocessor.

o    When emulating CRC, MATCHC, and MOVTUC instructions  on
     uVAXen the registers and condition codes were being set
     incorrectly in some corner cases.  This has been fixed.

o    A security hole in kernel affecting  VAX  CPUs  without
     PDP-11 compatibility mode support (uVAXen and VAX 8200)
     has  been  plugged.   The  hole  allowed  any  ordinary
     unprivileged  user  who  is able to run programs on the
     machine to cause a kernel panic by giving PSL<CM>=1  to
     the sigreturn(2) system call.

o    A kernel panic-causing bug in TCP has been fixed.   The
     kernel  could panic if a setsockopt(2) was attempted on
     a TCP socket that had its connection reset.   Fix  from
     4.4BSD.

o    Support for DEC DSV11 point-to-point links using  Cisco
     HDLC protocol.

o    Sendmail  cf  files:  the  prophecy  has   come   true.
     HOSTS.TXT  is gone, everyone uses DNS, and there are no
     more NIC-registered hosts to worry about.

o    Several new MSCP disks have been added to  the  distri-
     buted  /etc/disktab  and to the compiled-in disk tables
     in the uda(4) and kdb(4) drivers.

o    The MicroVAX boot code no longer requires the boot disk
     to  be unit 0.  It must still be on the first MSCP con-
     troller, though.

o    An RX50 console floppy is now available for  the  stan-
     dard system to bootstrap on a VAX 8200.
