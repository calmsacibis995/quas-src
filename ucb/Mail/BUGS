While you're there... the 'u' command fails if 
the message hasn't been deleted; it seems reasonable
that it should just move you to that message.

Hi, the bug report ~bugs/4.2BSD/ucb/116 seems valid, and,
since you seem to have that particular piece of code all
locked up, I thought I'd pass it to you.

As long as you're in there hacking, you might as well fix echo() so that
it finishes with a newline instead of a blank. E.g., "echo foo" comes out
as "foo " instead of "foo\n".
