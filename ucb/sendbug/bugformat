-------- Remove this line and what's below it, for reference only. --------

To ensure that your bug report is handled correctly by bugfiler(8),
you must replace "folder" (on the line above starting with "Index:")
with one of the following values:

	folder  ::= bin | doc | etc | games | ideas | include | lib | local
			| man | misc | new | sys | ucb | usr.bin | usr.lib

If you're not running 4.3BSD, you should also replace "4.3BSD" on the
same line with one of the following values.

	version ::= V7 | 2BSD | 4.1BSD | 4.2BSD | 4.3BSD

For example, if your bug concerns the program "/usr/bin/file" and you're
currently running 4.2BSD, you should replace "folder" with "usr.bin", and
"4.3BSD" with "4.2BSD".  The folder "ideas" is for suggestions.
