 * The following are the low-level opcodes exchanged between the
 * two sides.  These are designed to allow for type, sequence number,
 * and direction checking.
 *
 * We enforce conversation flow.  There are three states: CONTENTION,
 * SEND, and RECEIVE.  Both sides start in CONTENTION.
 * We never leave RECEIVE state without first reading a TURNAROUND
 * opcode.  We never leave SEND state without first writing a TURNAROUND
 * opcode.  This scheme ensures that we always have conversation flowing
 * in a synchronized direction (or detect an application error), and that
 * we never hang with both sides trying to read from the "wire".
 *
 * State	event			action
 *
 * CONTENTION	read request		send TURNAROUND
 *					read RTS
 *					enter RECEIVE
 * CONTENTION	write request		send RTS
 *					read TURNAROUND
 *					enter SEND
 *
 * RECEIVE	read request		read whatever
 * RECEIVE	write request		read TURNAROUND
 *
 * SEND		read request		send TURNAROUND
 * SEND		write			write whatever
