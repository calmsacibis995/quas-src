/* LOG10(X)
 * RETURN THE BASE 10 LOGARITHM OF x
 * DOUBLE PRECISION (VAX D format 56 bits, IEEE DOUBLE 53 BITS)
 * CODED IN C BY K.C. NG, 1/20/85; 
 * REVISED BY K.C. NG on 1/23/85, 3/7/85, 4/16/85.
 * 
 * Required kernel function:
 *	log(x)
 *
 * Method :
 *			     log(x)
 *		log10(x) = ---------  or  [1/log(10)]*log(x)
 *			    log(10)
 *
 *    Note:
 *	  [log(10)]   rounded to 56 bits has error  .0895  ulps,
 *	  [1/log(10)] rounded to 53 bits has error  .198   ulps;
 *	  therefore, for better accuracy, in VAX D format, we divide 
 *	  log(x) by log(10), but in IEEE Double format, we multiply 
 *	  log(x) by [1/log(10)].
 *
 * Special cases:
 *	log10(x) is NaN with signal if x < 0; 
 *	log10(+INF) is +INF with no signal; log10(0) is -INF with signal;
 *	log10(NaN) is that NaN with no signal.
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *	log10(X) returns the exact log10(x) nearly rounded. In a test run
 *	with 1,536,000 random arguments on a VAX, the maximum observed
 *	error was 1.74 ulps (units in the last place).
 *
 * Constants:
 * The hexadecimal values are the intended ones for the following constants.
 * The decimal values may be used, provided that the compiler will convert
 * from decimal to binary accurately enough to produce the hexadecimal values
 * shown.
