#####		SMTP UUCP Mailer specification
#####
#####	This mailer sends UUCP traffic over an SMTP connection.
#####	Obviously, we only want to do this with UUCP hosts with
#####	whom we have SMTP connectivity.  The idea here is to
#####	avoid having to double queue (once for sendmail, once
#####	for UUCP) when there's no need.  Since we need to
#####	preserve uucp-ness (e.g., bangs), we use the UUCP mailer
#####	rewriting rulesets.
